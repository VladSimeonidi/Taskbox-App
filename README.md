# Taskbox-App
The Taskbox App is a task management application that allows users to efficiently organize their daily tasks. It features three main pages: a welcoming page, an "About Us" page, and a “Tasks list” page. The welcoming page provides a friendly introduction to the app and encourages users to explore its features. The "About Us" page offers information about the app. The“Tasks list” page is the core functionality of the app, allowing users to add tasks, delete individual tasks, and clear all tasks at once.

During the design process, I focused on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. I aimed for a clean and intuitive layout that would enhance the user experience. I faced with challenge of implementing the functionality to add, delete, and manage tasks efficiently. Careful consideration was given to data storage, retrieval, and user interactions to provide a smooth experience. Lastly, ensuring the app's compatibility across different devices and screen sizes

Despite these challenges, the end result is an effective task management app that provides users with a simple and organized way to handle their daily tasks.
